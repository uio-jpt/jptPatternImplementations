Implementation of design patterns with package templtes
=======================================================

This is an implemenation of the design patterns from the seminal *Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable 
Object-Oriented Software* book by the "Gang of Four", Gamma et al., from 1994. The implementation is
done with package templates for Java, and the source code is based on a corresponding implementation
performed by Hannemann and Kiczales for their paper *Design Pattern Implementation in Java and AspectJ*:
http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=582436. The code for the AspectJ implementation can be found here:
http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/spl/projects/aodps.html. 

We are grateful to Hannemann and Kiczales for making their source code publicly available.
