Needs a separate class with statics to handle setting up the chain itself. This is handled by the ...aspectOf() instance in the AJ version.

Default interface implementations would be useful here, to support the default setup by AJ where a Handler will reject a request by default.

The original implementation used pointcuts and advice, we have here used a tabstract method instead (Button.doClick()).
