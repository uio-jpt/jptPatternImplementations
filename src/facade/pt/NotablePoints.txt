We utilize PT capabilities to merge classes, allowing ordinary OO overrides of the Facade implementations. 

The AJ implementation utilizes the aspect to warn (at compile time) the users if they are using methods of the encapsulated object directly,
instead of using the Facade. This is not needed in PT, as the implementation with addition classes will make it impossible to access the
encapsulated methods without going through the Facade, if it is applied.
