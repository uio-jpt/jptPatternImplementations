The AOP implementation uses pointcuts in order to change the state when the queue is updated. This could be done with pointcuts and advice in 
PT as well, but it is even simpler to do it just with tsuper in adds-classes, as the example shows. The overridden tsuper-methods have a
much simpler signature, compared to the aspects, as well.

The reason it is equally easy to use tsuper, is that each pointcut really only deals with one kind of method call each, and thus there is no
real need for AOP features beyond "after that method has executed, do this".
