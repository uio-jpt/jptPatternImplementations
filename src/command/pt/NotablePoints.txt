The pointcut implicitly applies only to the currently executing object (since it is defined within that class). This in contrast to AspectJ.

We can make the Button.clicked() method tabstract, instead of just supplying an empty method to which the advice can bind.

Since we do not keep state in a central aspect, the need for mappings through global hash tables are gone. Typical example:
 ButtonCommanding.aspectOf().setCommand(button2, com2); in AJ is turned into
 button2.setCommand(com2); in PT
