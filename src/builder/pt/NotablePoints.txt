Paraphrased from the AJ description:
	For Java, there is the problem that the Builder role (here named Creator) has to be an abstract class (and not an interface), since it needs 
to contain fields and method implementations. Consequently, all ConcreteBuilders have to have that class as their superclass, making it 
impossible to be part of another class hierarchy.
	For PT, this can be handled through class merging or several additions to the same class. Note how we create a single template for the
Creator implementation, CreatorImpl, and let this implementation implement an interface from a package. This way, we can instantiate and
merge mutliple times without having problems with typing things correctly.
